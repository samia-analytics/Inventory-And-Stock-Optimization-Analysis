# Inventory-And-Stock-Optimization-Analysis
This project analyzes retail inventory data to identify stock optimization opportunities. SQL was used to clean, transform, and aggregate raw sales and inventory data into analysis-ready tables. Tableau Public was used to visualize slow-moving categories, stockout risks, dead stock value, and overall inventory performance.
