📦 Inventory and Stock Optimization Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail inventory data to identify stock optimization opportunities, focusing on slow-moving items, stockouts, and dead stock value. The dashboard is designed to support inventory management and decision-making by highlighting high-risk categories.

The analysis is built using SQL for data preparation and Tableau Public for visualization.

🧠 Business Questions Answered

Which product categories are slow-moving?

Which categories are frequently at risk of stockouts?

How much capital is locked in dead stock?

Which categories require inventory optimization attention?

📊 Key Insights

Certain categories show high inventory levels but relatively lower sales, indicating overstock risk.

Dead stock contributes a significant monetary value, highlighting inefficient inventory allocation.

Category-level inventory turnover highlights relative movement differences across product categories.

📈 Dashboard Components

Total Inventory Value KPI

Dead Stock Value KPI

Slow-Moving Items by Category

Stockout Analysis

Dead Stock Value Breakdown (Treemap)

Inventory Turnover by Category (Comparative Index)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL – data cleaning, aggregation, and metric preparation

Tableau Public – dashboard creation and visualization

CSV datasets – cleaned and structured for analysis

⚠️ Notes & Assumptions

The dataset does not contain SKU-level granularity; therefore, analysis is performed at the category level.

Inventory turnover is used as a relative comparison metric, not an exact operational KPI.

This project uses a public retail dataset for learning and demonstration purposes.

🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

Business-oriented data analysis

Correct use of aggregation and visualization principles

Ability to translate data into actionable insights

Clean, professional dashboard design
This project analyzes retail inventory data to identify stock optimization opportunities. SQL was used to clean, transform, and aggregate raw sales and inventory data into analysis-ready tables. Tableau Public was used to visualize slow-moving categories, stockout risks, dead stock value, and overall inventory performance.
